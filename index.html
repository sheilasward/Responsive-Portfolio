      <p>I have been an Application Developer for over 20 years in the insurance industry, 
        and I love coding!  I have worked with a variety of languages and platforms during 
        my employment at Lincoln Financial, until my job was eliminated because of outsourcing.
        Most of my work at Lincoln included Back End mainframe work, writing in COBOL, DB2, 
        Easytrieve Plus, SAS, and of course, JCL.  However, while there, I taught myself
        HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and learned enough PHP to write a program for production.
        I also spent several years learning and writing Crystal Reports, and the ways to join
        databases to produce those reports.
        During the last few years I was there, I wrote in Back End Javascript to gather 
        information from LifeComm to feed Lincoln's Customer Service Accelerator system.
      </p> 
        
      <p>Since my layoff from Lincoln, I have been attending Guilford Technical Community
        College, studying Web Development.  Classes I have taken include learning the languages
        of Python and Javascript, and learning about Full Stack developing through a Web Design
        course.  I also learned to make Web Apps for Android with MIT App Inventor.  I am currently
        attending the Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp for more in-depth knowledge about Full Stack development,
        and learning some tools that I have not had experience with yet.
        </p>  
        <p>Some of the work that I did at Lincoln includes:
        <ul>
          <li>Developing and maintaining a PC Accounting System in Realia Cobol</li>
          <li>Assisting Agency Team in Y2K modifications in Easytrieve code</li>
          <li>Writing and Maintaining Crystal Reports for Management Information</li>
          <li>Attended training sessions in SAS at Cary, NC, and used SAS to write many programs.</li>
          <li>Automated the Unclaimed Property Process and created emails for each admin,
            with key statistics in the email
          </li>
          <li>Automated the NY Triennial Report to produce files with the year in the filename</li>
          <li>Modified LifeComm's Unadmitted Replacements Report, which cut down
            the report length from approximately 2000 pages to around 20 pages.
          </li>
          <li>Wrote around 25-30 brushfires per year to correct LifeComm admin records.</li>
          <li>Became the Autosys SME for the LifeComm team</li>
          <li>Wrote approximately 35-40 services in backend Javascript to feed Lincoln's 
            Customer Service Accelerator system</li>
          </li>
          
        </ul>
